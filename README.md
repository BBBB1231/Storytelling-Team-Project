# Storytelling-Team-Project
This final project is dedicated to the APAN 5800 Fall25 - Analytics Term Project :: interactive communication and Final Presentation

Create a visual, communication with interactive, explanatory data graphics that enable the chief marketing executive at your selected organization to explore insights into at least two nontrivial questions concerning your project in the context of his or her CMO responsibilities at the organization.

For guidance on the responsibilities of a marketing executive — and their general knowledge of data and data graphics — review Spencer (2024 Links to an external site.), §. 1.2.1.2 and the cited references Carr (2019 Links to an external site.) and Carr (2018 Links to an external site.).

As with previous audiences, conduct online research (google searches, linkedin, …) to understand the viewpoint of your new audience.

For interactivity, employ three or more techniques discussed in class: e.g., linking multiple types of visual encodings for data to interactions like hovering, clicking, filtering, selecting, dragging and scrollytelling. These interactions should be relevant to — and directly support — the CMO exploring data for insights, their limits, and context to your research questions.

Your communication can be organized either as a grid or a scrollytelling-style document.

Recall the three laws of communication from Doumont (2009 Links to an external site.).

Your narrative should 1) direct your audience to your exploratory purpose (using the best communication and visualization practices we’ve been developing in the course), 2) guide the audience in how they should explore using your interactive data graphics (using messages in titles, (sub)headers, labels, annotations, and other concise text), and 3) explain why they should explore, how can they act on your messages.

For this assignment, it will generally be best to create your interactive graphics in R markdown and R plus available packages like we’ve discussed in class, or in Tableau or combining both into a single html.

If you choose to use other interactive languages like Vega, Shiny, or D3.js directly, first consult with your professor to assess viability, given your time constraints.

This is an opportunity for you to gain experience combining all the narrative and visual techniques we’ve discussed this semester, and use interactive graphics to communicate with this new audience.

Your project will be assessed on the following:

- Includes a visual narrative flow that uses a title, (sub)headers, labels, and annotations to get the audience interested, understand, and be able to visually explore data concerning the questions presented;

- Develops two or more non-trivial questions that are visually explorable with data, relevant to the marketing executive’s responsiblities, and related to the student’s project;

- Includes three or more different forms of interactivity for data graphics, one of which includes linking two graphics. The interactivities directly relate — provide views, context, or focus — to data concerning the questions presented;

- Communication as a whole consistently uses color and typographic principles to link related concepts together, and aligns and organizes information to guide audience through the narrative. Goes beyond imitating examples; and

- individual contribution to group work.
